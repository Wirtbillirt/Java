The project involves developing a highly sophisticated management system for an international transportation company that handles a wide variety of vehicles, including airplanes, ships, trucks, freight trains, and delivery drones, to transport goods of all types between multiple countries with diverse infrastructures and regulations.

The system must be capable of calculating not only the time and cost of delivering goods based on the selected vehicle type and the distance between the origin and destination countries but also consider additional factors such as:

Extreme weather conditions that may affect vehicle operations.
Different types of cargo and their special handling and safety requirements.
Customs regulations and trade restrictions between countries.
Dynamic changes in vehicle availability due to maintenance, repairs, or upgrades.
Route optimization to minimize costs and delivery times, considering traffic congestion, tolls, and terrain conditions.

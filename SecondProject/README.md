# Java
Second Project

Ensure that the user inputs valid values for residency and hours at home.

Instead of simply asking the user to enter a number, we could present a more interactive menu with descriptive options.

Allow the application to handle information for multiple users and provide individual recommendations for each one.

In addition to residency and hours at home, we could include other factors that influence the pet recommendation, such as allergies, available space, userâ€™s activity level, etc.

Store user information and preferences in a database or file so the application can remember user preferences in future sessions.

Utilize more advanced algorithms to recommend the most suitable pet based on multiple factors and user preferences.

Implement more robust exception handling to manage any potential errors during the application's execution.
